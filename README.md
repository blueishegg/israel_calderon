## Welcome to my portfolio!

Unsure what to include in this file at the moment but I will use it to note down my objectives.

1 - Setup up the HTML, CSS and JS files ðŸ’¹

2 - In our index file input the necessary tags for our items from the landing page. ðŸ’¹

3 - Create assets folder to store and map images to index file ðŸ’¹

4 - Give tags appropriate class names

5 - Import Noto Sans JP from google fonts
