        <p class="main_text">
          Born in La Paz, Bolivia on October 21, 1991. My family took a leap of
          faith and migrated to London in November 1997 when I was 6 years old.
        </p>
        <p class="main_text">
          I have created this page to showcase who I am as a person on this
          journey we call life and to record my professional development as a
          software engineer.
        </p>

        <p class="main_text">
          November 2021, I decided to leave my job as a Quality Assurance
          Advisor for the RCS England and take a deep dive into a field that I
          find a lot more interesting and really push my strongest skills and
          abilities to its limits.
        </p>

        <p class="main_text">
          This page will continue to evolve and I intend to record every stage.
          To start things off, these first two pages have been created with the
          core fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Later on I plan to use
          a familiar framwork to me, React.
        </p>

        <p class="main_text">
          I hope you enjoy getting to know me through my page and if you would
          like to get in contact, just send me an email!
